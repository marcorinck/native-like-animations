# NativeLikeAnimations

Inspired by this article about native-like animations for page transitions on the web (which uses vuejs) 
I tried to implement something like it but in just Angular (+ web animations). 

This is just an example project (based on Angular CLI) with some basic animations that feel like native page transitions on a mobile OS.

Although, Angular Material is used for some basic stylings, the animations use stock Angular 6 and web animations, plus some css styling/transitions. 

Almost all of the transitions are implemented in the app component. Additional components exist only to demonstrate the page transitions.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0-rc.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
